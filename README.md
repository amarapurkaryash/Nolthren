## Overview

Nolthren is an innovative, AI-powered README generator designed to help developers create professional, comprehensive, and engaging `README.md` files for their GitHub repositories with unparalleled ease. Leveraging advanced natural language processing and repository analysis, Nolthren automates the often tedious process of documenting projects, allowing you to focus more on development.

Simply provide a GitHub repository URL, user/repo shorthand, or a GitHub username, and Nolthren will intelligently fetch relevant data, analyze your codebase (programming languages, dependencies, file structure), and generate a well-structured Markdown file. The generated README includes essential sections like project overview, tech stack, key features, installation guides, and even dynamic project badges.

With a focus on customization, Nolthren allows you to interactively modify, enable, or disable any section, ensuring the final output perfectly reflects your project's unique identity. It's the ultimate tool for maintaining high-quality documentation, attracting contributors, and clearly communicating your project's value.

## Key Functions

Nolthren's functionality is driven by several core functions that handle user input, repository interaction, and README generation. Here's an overview of some critical functions:

### `handleProcessInput(valueToProcess?: string)`

This function is responsible for parsing user input in the main search bar. It acts as a smart dispatcher, determining if the input is a full GitHub URL, a `user/repo` shorthand, or just a GitHub username. Based on this determination, it then calls the appropriate handler (`handleGenerate` for repositories or `handleFetchRepos` for usernames) to proceed with fetching data.

### `handleExampleClick(exampleValue: string)`

This utility function updates the input field with a provided example value and then immediately triggers the `handleProcessInput` function with that example, simulating a user typing and submitting an example repository or username.

### `handleReset()`

This function clears all input fields, repository lists, generated sections, and error/status states, effectively resetting the application to its initial state, ready for new input.

### `handleFetchRepos(userToFetch: string)`

Dedicated to fetching public repositories for a given GitHub username. It updates the application's status, clears previous results, and handles potential errors, including prompting for GitHub API keys if issues arise during the fetch.

### `handleGenerate(urlToProcess: string)`

This is the central function for initiating the README generation process. It first validates the provided GitHub repository URL, then sets the application status to 'fetching' and clears any previous results. It orchestrates the entire generation flow, including setting up progress updates and handling potential API errors (both GitHub and Gemini).

### `handleRegenerateSection(sectionId: string)`

Allows users to regenerate specific sections of the README. This function targets the specified `sectionId` and, depending on the section type (e.g., `project_badges`, `project_tagline`, or other content sections), calls the relevant regeneration logic. It also handles error reporting and API key modal display for both GitHub and Gemini issues.

### `finalReadmeContent` (useMemo hook)

This memoized value dynamically constructs the complete README content by iterating through the `sections` state. It intelligently inserts badges, handles placeholder sections, and filters out invisible sections to create the final Markdown string ready for display and download.

### `generateTocContent(sections: Section[])`

A helper function that generates the Markdown content for the Table of Contents. It filters visible sections (excluding the title, tagline, badges, and TOC itself) and formats them as a bulleted list with anchor links.

### `App: React.FC` (useState hooks)

The main `App` component utilizes numerous `useState` hooks to manage the application's global state, including user input, fetched repositories, generated sections and badges, error/status messages, API key modal visibility, generation progress, and UI theme. These state variables collectively drive the application's dynamic behavior.

### `renderedContent` (useMemo hook)

This memoized value takes the `readmeContent` (the final Markdown string) and processes it using the `marked` library. It includes a custom renderer to add `id` attributes to headings for anchor linking and a special HTML renderer to identify and visually represent embedded video content within the README.

## Important Files

Nolthren's codebase is structured to be modular and easy to navigate. Here are some of the key files and directories:

*   `App.tsx`: The main application component, orchestrating the overall UI and state management.
*   `main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
*   `package.json`: Defines project metadata and lists all necessary dependencies and devDependencies.
*   `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for the Vite build tool.
*   `components/`: This directory contains all reusable React components, each typically in its own file.
    *   `components/HomePage.tsx`: Renders the initial landing page and input form.
    *   `components/ReadmeDisplay.tsx`: Handles the rendering and preview of the generated README markdown.
    *   `components/BadgeManager.tsx`: Manages the dynamic generation and display of project badges.
    *   `components/ApiKeysModal.tsx`: Manages the modal for entering and configuring API keys (GitHub, Gemini).
*   `src/lib/`: Likely contains utility functions, API integration logic, and helper modules.
*   `public/`: Contains static assets like the `index.html` file and other resources not processed by the build pipeline.
